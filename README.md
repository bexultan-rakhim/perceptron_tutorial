# perceptron_tutorial

This repository provides Jupyter-notebook based tutorial on how to implement perceptron using numpy and matplotlib.
This is mostly used for educational purpose to explain how machine learning works. 

There is a solution implementation by me, however, try to solve this by yourself.
